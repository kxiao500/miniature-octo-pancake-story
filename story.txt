In the deep,shadowy depths of the ocean, there live thousands and thousands
of octopuses. All of them did the same thing; they swam around, ate 
crustaceans, and shot ink at unfriendly predators. However, there was one 
octopus who was not like the rest. By some strange anomaly, he had come to
develop an incessant desire for pancakes. His name was Peter. Naturally, living
in the depths of the ocean was rather unfavorable for such a specimen. And so 
one day, he decided to embark on an adventure that would change his life 
forever; the journey to the surface.
